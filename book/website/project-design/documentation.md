# [DRAFT] Documentation

Documentation is one of the key components of a project, as it adds context to your work.

{Most researchers find documentation daunting, as they think that research-related responsibilities are already overwhelming for them. It’s obvious that they see documentation as an ‘added labour’ and not important enough for carrying out a research design, implementation, analysis or publication work.

The reality is that documentation is an integral part of all research processes, from start to finish. [Add reference to <https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/03-setup/index.html#provide-a-process-for-documentation>]}
