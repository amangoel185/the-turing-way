# Documentation

<!-- Landing page: Explain the 'why and how', also explain what your chapter covers (overview: project documentation chapter highights, Technical document).

Documentation is one of the key components of a project, as it adds context to your work.

{Most researchers find documentation daunting, as they think that research-related responsibilities are already overwhelming for them. It’s obvious that they see documentation as an ‘added labour’ and not important enough for carrying out a research design, implementation, analysis or publication work.

The reality is that documentation is an integral part of all research processes, from start to finish. [Add reference to <https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/03-setup/index.html#provide-a-process-for-documentation>]}

## Types of Documentation in Research and Data Science

### Project Documentation

[provide Summary]

See {ref}`pd-project-repo<Creating Project Repositories>` chapter for details.

### Data Documentation and Metadata

All information accompanying data should be documented and shared along with data.
Data documentation allows data-users to gain sufficient information to understand the source, strengths, weaknesses, and analytical limitations of the data so that they can make informed decisions when using it.

Data documentation includes metadata, which is a comprehensive information about the data descriptors that facilitate cataloguing data and data discovery. 
When data is submitted to a trusted data repository, the machine-readable metadata is generated by the repository. 
Even when the data can not be shaed openly, or is too large to share in a repository, a text file with machine-readable metadata can nonetheless be added as part of the documentation.
Although intended for machine reading, metadata is equally important for humans to understand what data contains before they download or open data files.

See {ref}`rr-rdm-metadata<Documentation and Metadata` chapter for details.

### Technical Documentation

[Provide summary]

[Explain that you will talk about it in the next subchapter]

## Overview of this Chapter

Besides learning about the technical documentation, you will also learn about what formatting languages and platform you can use for documentation.

Although these may sound too technical, you can always use the workflow that works for you to start your documentation process, invite collaborations and share them as they develop.
In a subchapter, we have curated examples of some sommonly used workflow that you can choose to begin your documentation journey.
